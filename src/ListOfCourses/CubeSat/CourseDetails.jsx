            CubeSat technology revolutionizes space exploration through small,
            cost-effective satellites designed for diverse applications, from
            scientific research to Earth observation. Interns will gain hands-on
            experience in ideation, design, and mission planning, familiarizing
            themselves with fundamental principles. They will collaborate on
            research projects, contributing to literature reviews, experimental
            design, and data analysis. Over a 30-day offline program,
            participants will enhance their skills while working toward the
            design and development of a CubeSat. This innovative approach
            fosters creativity and paves the way for future advancements in
            satellite technology.
